                Written by Onel de Guzman, the ILOVEYOU computer worm was estimated to have infected 50 million computers.<br>
                The worm was written to steal passwords, and the author never intended it to spread as far as it did.<br>
                <br>
                A worm is unique as it does not require a host program to infect. Most viruses infect host programs which will<br>
                inadvertently run the viruses, but worms run by themselves. This causes them to be hard to catch and easy to spread,<br>
                usually abusing vulnerabilites in the security of certian applications, like Emails.<br>
                <br>ILOVEYOU abused a certian oversight in emails. A victim would recive an email from someone they knew (likely<br>
                a friend or collegue) with the phrase "kindly check the attached LOVELETTER  coming from me."<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                By default, many email programs hid the filetype of attached files. In the screenshot, you can see that the attached<br>
                file pretends to be a text file, but if you enable file types, you'll see it's actually a VBS script.<br>
                When the file was downloaded, the worm would immeditly send itself to anyone in your contacts,<br>
                using the same phrase and file from earlier. It would also download a trojan in order to steal passwords,<br>
                though this would often go unnoticed.
                <br><br>
                Any file with the extensions jpg, jpeg, js, jse, css, wsh, sct, or hta would be overwritten with the worm, meaning<br>
                the original file is gone. This is where the main destructive power of the worm came from.<br>
                Due to the fact that malware was relatively new, no laws were put in place against releasing malware.<br>
                Because of this, Onel de Guzman was released with no charges.
