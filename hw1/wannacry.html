            WannaCry, or WannaCrypt, was a ransomware attack that started in 2017. While the author is assumed to be a Korean<br>
            hacker group known as the Lazarus Group, it has yet to be officially confirmed. While the initial attack only lasted<br>
            around one day, WannaCry was estimated to infect 300,000 computers.<br>
            <br>
            WannaCry is a ransomeware, which acts differently to other malware. Instead of overwritting files, ransomeware will encrypt<br>
            files or sensitive information and demand payment in order for the files to be decryped. In most cases, including WannaCry,<br>
            the payment is through cryptocurrency.<br>
            <br>
            When WannaCry infects a computer, it quickly encrypts all files it can access. A pop up will then be displayed, explaining<br>
            the situation and providing a bitcoin address.

            WannaCry abused a vulnerability in the SMB protocol of Windows. While there was a patch provided by Microsoft prior to<br>
            the attack, many computers weren't up to date.<br>
            <br>
            The attack only lasted a few hours, as a man named Marcus Hutchins discovered that purhcasing the domain that the malware<br>
            was tied to acted as a killswitch, effectively stopping the virus from spreading to other computers in the area. While he was <br>
            initally praised for his efforts, the large about of attention led the police to eventually discovering his involvement with<br>
            MalwareTech, leaning to his arrest.
