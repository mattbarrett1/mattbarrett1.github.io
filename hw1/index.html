                Malicious software, or Malware for short, are computer programs that deliberately cause harm to the user.
                While early malware was created simply for fun, it wouldn't take long before dangerous viruses were spread
                throughout the internet.

                Malware is catagorized differently depending on a few factors, mainly being how they spread and how they cause damage. 
                While there are far too many types to go into, I've chosen three distinct malware to not only demonstrate a certian subset
                of malware, but to also show what malware was created for and how it spreads.
