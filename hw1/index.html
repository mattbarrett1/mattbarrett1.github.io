                Malicious software, or Malware for short, are computer programs that deliberately cause harm to the user.<br>
                While early malware was created simply for fun, it wouldn't take long before dangerous viruses were spread
                throughout the internet.<br>
                Malware is catagorized differently depending on a few factors, mainly being how they spread and how they cause damage.<br> 
                While there are far too many types to go into, I've chosen three distinct malware to not only demonstrate a certian subset
                of malware,<br> but to also show what malware was created for and how it spreads.
                Sources for information will either be included directly below picture<br>or at the bottom of the screen, in the sources tab.
                If you are interested in the topic, I highly reccomend looking into it!
