                Written and created by "justquant", Resonate is a seemingly harmless virus created as more of a joke rather than<br>
                a real threat. While the original source code was taken down by the author, a user by the name of "RecreatingResonate"<br>
                reuploaded it to Github, or at least what was left of it.<br>
                <br>
                As mentioned previously, Resonate wasn't created to cause real harm. I included this to show that there exists a small<br>
                group of people who create viruses simply out of fun, and to flex their power to other hackers. Most early malware was<br>
                built this way. For example, Creeper, which was believed to be the first virus, simply displayed the phrase<br>
                <q>I AM THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN</q>
                <br>
                without causing any real damage.
                <br><br>
                Resonate will infect files upon being run, like most viruses. However, the interesting aspects of Resonate activate<br>
                only on certian date. These are known as "payloads", which are used to describe sets of instructions carried out by viruses.<br>
                Notable resonate payloads include causing icons to explode when clicked, playing an endless loop of the Super Mario Brothers 3 Theme,<br>
                or covering the entire screen with a pixelated image of Fred Durst (See image below)

            <p>
                As mentioned previously, Resonate may cause some damage to systems by overwritting files, but it wasn't created maliciously<br>
                and the only way a system can be infected is if the user voluntarily downloads the virus itself.
